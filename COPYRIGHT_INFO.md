## 100% Original & Copyright-Free 🎵

All sounds in this beat machine are **completely original** and **copyright-free**, generated using Web Audio API synthesis.

### How It Works

This application uses **procedural audio synthesis** to create sounds in real-time. No pre-recorded samples are used by default. Every sound is generated mathematically using:

- **Oscillators** - Generate waveforms (sine, sawtooth, square, triangle)
- **Filters** - Shape the frequency content
- **Envelopes** - Control volume over time
- **Noise Generators** - Create percussive textures

### Copyright-Free Sounds Included

#### Drum Sounds (Synthesized)
- **Kick Drum** - Sine wave with pitch envelope (150Hz → 40Hz)
- **Snare Drum** - Triangle oscillator + filtered white noise
- **Hi-Hat (Closed)** - High-pass filtered noise (7000Hz+)
- **Hi-Hat (Open)** - Longer duration high-pass noise
- **Clap** - Multiple short noise bursts with bandpass filter
- **Tom** - Pitch-swept sine wave (200Hz → 80Hz)
- **Ride Cymbal** - Multiple square wave oscillators (metallic)
- **Tink/Cowbell** - Square wave at 800Hz

#### Melodic Instruments (Synthesized)
- **Bass** - Sawtooth oscillator with lowpass filter
- **Keys** - Dual oscillators (sine + triangle) for rich tone
- **Lead** - Sawtooth with sweeping lowpass filter

#### Advanced Bass Synthesis (6 Types - All Original)
- **Sub Bass** - Pure sine wave with sub oscillator for deep low-end
- **808 Bass** - Classic hip-hop bass with pitch envelope and sub layer
- **Reese Bass** - Multiple detuned sawtooth waves for DnB/Jungle
- **Acid Bass** - Sawtooth with resonant filter sweep for techno/acid house
- **Pluck Bass** - Triangle wave with fast envelope for house/dance
- **Growl Bass** - Multi-oscillator with LFO modulation for dubstep/bass music

#### Genre-Specific Bassline Presets (100% Original Patterns)
All bassline patterns are original compositions created specifically for this project:

1. **Trap** - 808 bass with trap-style rhythm pattern
2. **House** - Four-on-the-floor pluck bass pattern
3. **Dubstep** - Wobble bass with half-time rhythm
4. **Funk** - Syncopated bass groove with plucks
5. **Hip-Hop** - Classic boom-bap 808 pattern
6. **Techno** - 16th-note acid bass sequence
7. **Drum & Bass (DnB)** - Reese bass with fast breaks
8. **Jazz** - Walking bass line pattern

These patterns are **mathematically generated rhythms** and **not sampled** from any copyrighted material.

### Usage Rights

✅ **You Can:**
- Use these sounds in any project (personal or commercial)
- Modify and remix the synthesis algorithms
- Share and distribute the application
- Create and sell music using these sounds
- Use all bassline patterns in commercial productions
- Modify genre presets and create your own
- Export and use recorded patterns royalty-free

❌ **No Attribution Required:**
- These are procedurally generated sounds, not samples
- Bassline patterns are original algorithmic compositions
- No royalties, licenses, or permissions needed
- Completely free to use in all contexts

### Technical Details

All sounds are generated using the **Web Audio API**, a built-in browser technology that creates audio programmatically. This means:

1. **No sample libraries** - Nothing is pre-recorded
2. **No copyright concerns** - All sounds are algorithmically created
3. **Customizable** - You can modify the synthesis code
4. **Lightweight** - No audio files to load or store
5. **Real-time synthesis** - Sounds are generated on-the-fly
6. **Original patterns** - All genre presets use original rhythmic compositions

#### Bassline Sequencer Technical Features
- **16-step sequencer** with 8-note range
- **6 synthesis engines** for different bass types
- **8 genre presets** with optimized parameters
- **Pattern bank** - Save up to 4 patterns (A, B, C, D)
- **Advanced controls**: Filter cutoff, resonance, distortion, glide
- **Real-time parameter adjustment** while playing
- **Octave selection** (1-3) for different frequency ranges

### Sound Mode Toggle

The app includes a "Synth Mode" button that lets you switch between:
- **🎹 Synth Mode** (default) - Uses original synthesized sounds
- **🎵 Sample Mode** - Can use custom audio samples if you add them

### Legal

These synthesized sounds are considered **public domain** as they are mathematical algorithms, not creative works. The synthesis algorithms themselves are part of the open-source code.
